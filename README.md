# AmtrakTrainTracker


<!-- I travel home from college via Amtrak, and at the station I have a very slow data connection, and as a result I have no clue where my train is. The Official Amtrak Train Tracker is extremely data-intensive and takes a very long time to load on the occasions it does. I needed a lightweight website that I can use so I built this! It's an extremely lightweight app that uses the [Amtraker API](https://github.com/piemadd/Piero-Amtrak-API-Docs)  to gather train information, map it, and display it in a nice format!  -->
